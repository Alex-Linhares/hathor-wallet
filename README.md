`npm run electron`

If you have an error building `Error: Python executable "/path/to/python" is v3.6.5, which is not supported by gyp.`

Just run `npm config set python /usr/bin/python` and try again

## TODO

- The algorithm to automatically choose the unspent transactions when sending tokens is naive. For now we do not consider any anonymity factor.
- The addresses shared with the user and the ones used in change outputs are generated by the same chain in the HD Wallet. We don't separate internal and external addresses.
- The address version byte for testnet and mainnet are the same.
